more descriptions)

to make a variable, you should code like:
(variable_name) is value of (value)

and to make an if-statement, you should code like:
it is if of (variable_name)            # if
(some codes)
it is end
it is elseif of (variable_name)        # elif
(some codes)
it is end
it is else                             # else
(some codes)
it is end

and to make a loop, you should code like:
(variable_name) is loop of (start_range) and (end_range)
(some codes)
it is end

and to break the loop, you should code like:
it is break

and when you want to execute it, you should:
  i) just run runws.exe and use it as an idle.
  ii) make a ".ws" file and execute it with runws.exe
  //running .ws file with runws.py is not recommended. just use runws.exe. it's more convenient, just use exe files

note: the variable 'it' does the same action as python's '_' variable.
